                    Writing HTML I try to stick to semantic markup, to use the possibilities of HTML5.
                    Also I like the idea breaking the page into components (with isolated styles and js)
                    and reuse them over the application.

            <td>
                <p>
                    Working with CSS I especially like using preprocessors like Sass or SCSS, that give a developer
                    a lot of useful tools to solve the problems faster and produce cleaner, more readable code.
                    Variables, mixins, functions are great help when you need to write a large stylesheets with
                    thousands of css rules.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Nowadays, possibilities that offer us CSS3 are irreplaceable and can help to realize almost
                    every wish of a designer or a client. I like to use the features of CSS3 in projects. For example,
                    CSS3 media queries are great when there is a task to make the responsive design.
                    Box-shadows and border radiuses are a front-end developers' nightmare without CSS3!

            <td class="lang">JavaScript / Typescript</td>
            <td>
                <p>
                    I like JS for its unique prevalence in the world and I follow the news of language realizations with great interest.
                    I appreciate the usage of ES6+ features and I absolutely love TypeScript.
                    I consider modern frameworks like Vue.js and React to be the great tools for front-end developers,
                    that help us to make complex applications with less effort and to be more productive.

    <h2>Major Projects</h2>

    <h3 class="company">PeerStreet (US)</h3>
    <h4>5/2015 <span>&#x2192;</span> 07/2020</h4>

    <p class="description">
        PeerStreet is a fintech company that deals with crowdfunding in real estate.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
        I worked 5 years for PeerStreet. During this time I participated in a great deal of sub-projects.
        We built two new internal platforms for our own team members, which helped them to automate their work,
        fastened the processing of documents and facilitated the communication with our internal team members, clients,
        banks and organizations.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
        As a main JS framework we chose and used Vue.js.
        There were lots of interesting goals to meet at PeerStreet. I took part, for example, in development of automated
        investing project. We introduced to the user a bunch of settings, adjusting which he  or she could enable
        automated system of investing in new loans through our retail platform.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
        Another interesting project was to develop a prototype of a document processing platform. There
        we decided to use Bulma CSS framework with Vue.js. Bulma is a small lightweight framework,
        together with Vue.js it gave us a possibility to make an MVP and to start testing it in a short period of time.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
        At PeerStreet I cooperated tightly with the UX team and we solved a lot of user experience problems together.
    </p>

    <h3 class="company">StyleBee (US)</h3>
    <h4>02/2015 <span>&#x2192;</span> 10/2017</h4>

    <p class="description">
        StyleBee is an application for connecting stylists and clients.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
        As a front-end developer I dealt a lot with styling of the pages, adding new functionality,
        refactoring the old code. During my cooperation with StyleBee we made a complete redesign of all the app.
        As javascript framework we used Angular.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
        One of interesting projects at StyleBee was adding search for stylist and services by zipcode.
        I tightly cooperated with designers and UX specialists and together we found solutions to
        different interesting design solutions (one of them was to style the checkout process).
    </p>


    <h3 class="company">The Honest Company (US)</h3>
    <h4>02/2014 <span>&#x2192;</span> 5/2015</h4>

    <p class="description">
        Honest.com is a subscription based internet shop of diapers, wipes, organic cosmetics, home cleaning products, etc.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
        My responsibilities embraced dealing with CSS (Sass) and html (HAML)
        using Bootstrap to manage the responsive design, as well as writing jQuery to maintain small
        interactive parts.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
        As a JS framework we used Angular v1.
        While working at Honest we started decoupling the project into several microservices and also
        we started work on a new application, that was dealing with cosmetics.
    </p>


    <h3 class="company">Altoros Development (Belarus) / ShoeDazzle (US)</h3>
    <h4>02/2012 <span>&#x2192;</span> 12/2013</h4>

    <p class="description">
        As a member of huge international team took part in development of ShoeDazzle.com site and its
        mobile version.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
        ShoeDazzle is a big internet shop (written on Ruby on Rails) of shoes, handbags
        and accessories with a large client base in the USA.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
        As a HTML coder I dealt with CSS (Sass, SCSS) and html code mostly. During my work in ShoeDazzle team site was
        fully redesigned - that means, that almost all CSS and HTML code was rewritten or largely optimized.
        A lot of CSS3 and HTML5 features were used in redesign.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
        The practice of a/b testing was used on ShoeDazzle. That means that the same page could have been shown
        differently to different users and the developer should make it look good for everyone.
        Git was used to maintain version control.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
        At Altoros I also participated in development of mobile version of site for Fireplaces.com.
        My work included writing HTML and CSS code on the base of PSD templates, testing my work on iphone and android devices.
        The primary goal was to make the mobile site responsive - to look good on iphone, ipad and various android
        devices, that was achieved with the help of HTML5 and CSS3 features.
