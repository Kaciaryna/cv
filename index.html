                    Writing HTML I try to stick to semantic markup, use the possibilities of HTML5. Also I like the
                    idea of microformates, most ideas of BEM (Block-Element-Modifier - breaking the page into
                    independent blocks and reuse the code where it's possible).

                <p>
                    Working with CSS I especially like using preprocessors like Sass or Scss, that allow a developer
                    a lot of useful tools to develop faster and produce cleaner, more readable code.
                    Variables, mixins, functions are great help when you need to write a large stylesheets with
                    thousands of css rules.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Nowadays, possibilities that offer us CSS3 are irreplaceable and can help to realize almost
                    every wish of a designer or a client. I like to use the features of CSS3 in projects. For example,
                    CSS3 media queries are great when there is a task to make the responsive design.
                    Box-shadows and border radiuses are a fron-end developers' nightmare without CSS3!

                    I like JS and can write some code in pure JS or using frameworks, like jQuery.

    <h3 class="company">Altoros Development (Belarus) / ShoeDazzle (US)</h3>
    <h4>XX/XXXX <span>&#x2192;</span> present</h4>

    <p class="description">
        As a member of huge international team took part in development of ShoeDazzle.com site and its
        mobile version.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
        ShoeDazzle is a big internet shop (written on Ruby on Rails) of shoes, handbags
        and accessories with a large client base in the USA.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
        As a html coder I delt with css (<span class="experience">Sass</span>, SCSS) and html code mostly. During my work in ShoeDazzle team site was
        fully redesigned - that means, that almost all css and html code was rewritten or lagely optimized.
        A lot of <span class="experience">CSS3</span> feaures and <span class="experience">HTML5</span> tags were used in redesign.
        As for old browsers, was decided to drop support of IE7, and to use graceful degradation for IE8,9
        (to show the complicatedly designed elements more simpler for this browsers).
    </p>

    <p class="description">
        The practice of a/b testing was used on ShoeDazzle. That means that the same page could have been shown
        differently to different users and the developer should make it look good for everyone.
        Git is used to maintain version control.
