                <p>
                    Writing HTML I try to stick to semantic markup, to use the possibilities of HTML5. Also I like the
                    idea of microformats, most ideas of BEM (Block-Element-Modifier - breaking the page into
                    independent blocks and reuse the code where it's possible).
                </p>

        <tr>
            <td class="lang">CSS3 / Sass / Scss</td>
            <td>
                <p>
                    Working with CSS I especially like using preprocessors like Sass or Scss, that give a developer
                    a lot of useful tools to solve the problems faster and produce cleaner, more readable code.
                    Variables, mixins, functions are great help when you need to write a large stylesheets with
                    thousands of css rules.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Nowadays, possibilities that offer us CSS3 are irreplaceable and can help to realize almost
                    every wish of a designer or a client. I like to use the features of CSS3 in projects. For example,
                    CSS3 media queries are great when there is a task to make the responsive design.
                    Box-shadows and border radiuses are a front-end developers' nightmare without CSS3!

            <td class="lang">JavaScript / CoffeeScript</td>
            <td>
                <p>
                    I like JS and can write some code in pure JS or using frameworks, like jQuery.
                    Most problems that I solved using JavaScript referred to client interfaces.

    <h3 class="company">Altoros Development (Belarus) / ShoeDazzle (US)</h3>
    <h4>06/2012 <span>&#x2192;</span> present</h4>

    <p class="description">
        As a member of huge international team took part in development of ShoeDazzle.com site and its
        mobile version.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
        ShoeDazzle is a big internet shop (written on Ruby on Rails) of shoes, handbags
        and accessories with a large client base in the USA.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
        As a HTML coder I dealt with CSS (<span class="experience">Sass</span>, SCSS) and html code mostly. During my work in ShoeDazzle team site was
        fully redesigned - that means, that almost all CSS and HTML code was rewritten or largely optimized.
        A lot of <span class="experience">CSS3</span> and <span class="experience">HTML5</span> features were used in redesign.
        As for old browsers, was decided to drop support of IE7, and to use graceful degradation for IE8,9
        (to show the complicatedly designed elements simpler for these browsers).
    </p>

    <p class="description">
        The practice of a/b testing was used on ShoeDazzle. That means that the same page could have been shown
        differently to different users and the developer should make it look good for everyone.
        Git was used to maintain version control.
    </p>
    <p class="interesting-fact">
      Supported browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer 8+
    </p>

    <h4>04/2012 <span>&#x2192;</span> 06/2012</h4>

    <p class="description">
        I participated in development of mobile version of site for Fireplaces.com.
        My work included writing HTML and CSS code on the base of PSD templates, testing my work on iphone and android devices.
        I used <span class="experience">tortoiseSVN</span> - a utility to work with <span class="experience">SVN</span> version control.
        The primary goal was to make the mobile site <span class="experience">responsive</span> - to look good on iphone, ipad and various android
        devices, that was achieved with the help of <span class="experience">HTML5</span> and <span class="experience">CSS3</span> features.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main structure of HTML should have been designed to be able to be greatly customized for different brands with the use of
      CSS.
      My task was to write the code that can be easily reused for various brands with the minimum HTML changes.
    </p>

    <p>The main difficulty on this project was to test the code on variety of android devices, mostly to get all the needed devices.</p>

    <p class="interesting-fact">
      Supported browsers: Mobile safari on iphone, default browser on android
    </p>

        I took part in the development of new Altoros site - welcome.altoros.com.
        This site is less serious analog of Altoros.com site.
        My task was to apply design to <span class="experience">WordPress template</span>, adjust plugins for facebook, twitter,
        manage plugins for navigation.
